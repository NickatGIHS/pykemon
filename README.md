# Pykémon
A collection of small Pokémon-inspired projects.

### Current projects:
##### Incomplete:
 - Complete the 'Dex (Python)
##### Complete:
 - (None)

Feel free to change these into any other language, but please if you do tell me via an issue with the "*making my version*" tag, and credit me (at least in a comment in your code)!

These projects will be using a file that I will probably use a lot of - `pokemon.csv`. It is a CSV file that contains data for every Pokémon *ever* (Well, probably not really).

So that's about it! These are ***still works in progress***, and may not be done for a while.
