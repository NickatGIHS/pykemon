# complete-the-dex
A very simple little project that allows you to input Pokémon Games and consoles that you have (and methods of transferring Pokémon, e.g. Bank), and will output which games you need to get in order to complete the PokéDex!

This is a Python-based project, feel free to change it into any other language, but please if you do tell me and credit me (at least in a comment)!

This project will be using a file that, if I do any more Python-Pokémon projects, will be very common - `pokemon.csv`. It is a CSV file that contains data for every Pokémon *ever* (Well, probably not really). Thanks to [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) for the info.

So that's about it! This is ***still a work in progress***, and it may not be done for a while.
